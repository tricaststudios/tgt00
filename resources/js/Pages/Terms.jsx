                            of others. In the case of a business, the identity of major shareholders (for example, those holding 10 per cent or more
                            of the voting interest) should be verified. Generally, the shareholding of 25% will be considered as normal risk, and the
                            identity of the shareholder shall be verified. If 10% or more voting rights or shares are considered to be high risk, the
                            shareholder's identity must be verified.
